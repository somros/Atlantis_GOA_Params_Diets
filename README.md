# GOA_REEM_diet_Atlantis

This is a series of markdown documents and R scripts that generate diet composition information for GOA species from a number of data sources. For the REEM (https://apps-afsc.fisheries.noaa.gov/refm/reem/webdietdata/dietdataintro.php) data, the main file to look at is diet_comp_stratum.Rmd. The other scripts complement that information with diet data from GOAIERP (2015-2016) and previous Ecopath models (Aydin et al. 2007) for salmon and invertebrates, respectively.
